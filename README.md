# Data Science Stuff

This repo will inevitably become a dumping ground for all of the data science work which I do. This will include helper files, competition entries and tutorials.

### Helpers

Currently there is only a `common.py` helper file, which contains some usual functions pertaining to data science tasks. I will look to expand these helpers with various routines for wrangling data, plotting and building and training networks.

As time goes on I intend for these to become more complex and useful. For now it's relatively basic.

If you've got anything to add or ideas for improvement, please feel free to drop them in. I'm happy to see myself as a beginner in this space and am keen to learn any tricks or tips which may be useful.
